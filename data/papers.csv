We propose FlashDepth, a method that satisfies all three requirements, performing depth estimation on a 2044x1148 streaming video at 24 FPS. We show that, with careful modifications to pretrained single-image depth models, these capabilities are enabled with relatively little data and training. We evaluate our approach across multiple unseen datasets against state-of-the-art depth models, and find that ours outperforms them in terms of boundary sharpness and speed by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive accuracy. We hope our model will enable various applications that require high-resolution depth, such as video editing, and online decision-making, such as robotics.","['Gene Chou', 'Wenqi Xian', 'Guandao Yang', 'Mohamed Abdelfattah', 'Bharath Hariharan', 'Noah Snavely', 'Ning Yu', 'Paul Debevec']"

This approach underpins various aims, including out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, sample-efficient composition, and modeling of structured environments. Most research has focused on developing unsupervised mechanisms that separate objects into discrete slots in the representation space, evaluated using unsupervised object discovery. However, with recent sample-efficient segmentation models, we can separate objects in the pixel space and encode them independently. This achieves remarkable zero-shot performance on OOD object discovery benchmarks, is scalable to foundation models, and can handle a variable number of slots out-of-the-box. Hence, the goal of OCL methods to obtain object-centric representations has been largely achieved. Despite this progress, a key question remains: How does the ability to separate objects within a scene contribute to broader OCL objectives, such as OOD generalization? We address this by investigating the OOD generalization challenge caused by spurious background cues through the lens of OCL. We propose a novel, training-free probe called $\textbf{Object-Centric Classification with Applied Masks (OCCAM)}$, demonstrating that segmentation-based encoding of individual objects significantly outperforms slot-based OCL methods. However, challenges in real-world applications remain. We provide the toolbox for the OCL community to use scalable object-centric representations, and focus on practical applications and fundamental questions, such as understanding object perception in human cognition. Our code is available $\href{https://github.com/AlexanderRubinstein/OCCAM}{here}$.","['Alexander Rubinstein', 'Ameya Prabhu', 'Matthias Bethge', 'Seong Joon Oh']"

Unlike prior methods limited to specific image types (e.g., natural images or geometric visuals), our framework provides a unified solution for captioning natural images, visual text (e.g., posters, UIs, textbooks), and structured visuals (e.g., documents, tables, charts). By converting low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, our framework bridges the gap between visual and textual modalities. Our results highlight three key advantages: (i) Enhanced Visual Reasoning with LLMs, where long-context captions of visual modalities empower LLMs, particularly the DeepSeek-R1 series, to reason effectively in multimodal scenarios; (ii) Improved Image Generation, where detailed captions improve tasks like text-to-image generation and image transformation; and (iii) Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which enables faster convergence with less data. We believe the versatility and adaptability of OmniCaptioner can offer a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.","['Yiting Lu', 'Jiakang Yuan', 'Zhen Li', 'Shitian Zhao', 'Qi Qin', 'Xinyue Li', 'Le Zhuo', 'Licheng Wen', 'Dongyang Liu', 'Yuewen Cao', 'Xiangchao Yan', 'Xin Li', 'Botian Shi', 'Tao Chen', 'Zhibo Chen', 'Lei Bai', 'Bo Zhang', 'Peng Gao']"

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Despite recent advancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement capabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, refining skills, and skill composition. In this work, we introduce SkillWeaver, a skill-centric framework enabling agents to self-improve by autonomously synthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent autonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills practice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continually expands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing the agent's capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites demonstrate the efficacy of SkillWeaver, achieving relative success rate improvements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized by strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable skills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs, which can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.","['Boyuan Zheng', 'Michael Y.

In particular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for people to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this research, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated artwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic styles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental results yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an impressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.","['Meien Li', 'Mark Stamp']"

While multilingual benchmarks have expanded, both in size and languages, many rely on translations of English datasets, failing to capture cultural nuances. In this work, we propose Kaleidoscope, as the most comprehensive exam benchmark to date for the multilingual evaluation of vision-language models. Kaleidoscope is a large-scale, in-language multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across diverse languages and visual inputs. Kaleidoscope covers 18 languages and 14 different subjects, amounting to a total of 20,911 multiple-choice questions. Built through an open science collaboration with a diverse group of researchers worldwide, Kaleidoscope ensures linguistic and cultural authenticity. We evaluate top-performing multilingual vision-language models and find that they perform poorly on low-resource languages and in complex multimodal scenarios.

There has been an increasing interest in computational approaches that can predict gene expression directly from digitalized histopathology images. While image foundation models have shown promise in a variety of pathology downstream analysis, their performances on gene-expression prediction are still limited. Explicitly incorporating information from the transcriptomic models can help image models to address domain shift, yet the fine-tuning and alignment of foundation models can be expensive. In the work, we propose Parameter Efficient Knowledge trAnsfer (PEKA), a novel framework that leverages Block-Affine Adaptation and integrates knowledge distillation and structure alignment losses for cross-modal knowledge transfer. We evaluated PEKA for gene expression prediction using multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets (comprising 206,123 image tiles with matched gene expression profiles) that encompassed various types of tissue. PEKA achieved at least 5\% performance improvement over baseline foundation models while also outperforming alternative parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. We will release the code, datasets and aligned models after peer-review to facilitate broader adoption and further development for parameter efficient model alignment.","['Shi Pan', 'Jianan Chen', 'Maria Secrier']"

The core challenge of this task is how to construct a generalized feature space for novel categories with limited data on the basis of the base category space, which could adapt the learned detection model to unknown scenarios. However, limited by insufficient samples for novel categories, two issues still exist: (1) the features of the novel category are easily implicitly represented by the features of the base category, leading to inseparable classifier boundaries, (2) novel categories with fewer data are not enough to fully represent the distribution, where the model fine-tuning is prone to overfitting. To address these issues, we introduce the side information to alleviate the negative influences derived from the feature space and sample viewpoints and formulate a novel generalized feature representation learning method for FSOD. Specifically, we first utilize embedding side information to construct a knowledge matrix to quantify the semantic relationship between the base and novel categories. Then, to strengthen the discrimination between semantically similar categories, we further develop contextual semantic supervised contrastive learning which embeds side information. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting problems caused by sparse samples, a side-information guided region-aware masked module is introduced to augment the diversity of samples, which finds and abandons biased information that discriminates between similar categories via counterfactual explanation, and refines the discriminative representation space further. Extensive experiments using ResNet and ViT backbones on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, LVIS V1, FSOD-1K, and FSVOD-500 benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving the ability of FSOD in most shots/splits.","['Ruoyu Chen', 'Hua Zhang', 'Jingzhi Li', 'Li Liu', 'Zhen Huang', 'Xiaochun Cao']"

However, the field faces challenges in developing task-agnostic, reliable, and explainable evaluation metrics. This paper introduces CIGEval, a unified agentic framework for comprehensive evaluation of conditional image generation tasks. CIGEval utilizes large multimodal models (LMMs) as its core, integrating a multi-functional toolbox and establishing a fine-grained evaluation framework. Additionally, we synthesize evaluation trajectories for fine-tuning, empowering smaller LMMs to autonomously select appropriate tools and conduct nuanced analyses based on tool outputs. Experiments across seven prominent conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that CIGEval (GPT-4o version) achieves a high correlation of 0.4625 with human assessments, closely matching the inter-annotator correlation of 0.47. Moreover, when implemented with 7B open-source LMMs using only 2.3K training trajectories, CIGEval surpasses the previous GPT-4o-based state-of-the-art method. Case studies on GPT-4o image generation highlight CIGEval's capability in identifying subtle issues related to subject consistency and adherence to control guidance, indicating its great potential for automating evaluation of image generation tasks with human-level reliability.","['Jifang Wang', 'Xue Yang', 'Longyue Wang', 'Zhenran Xu', 'Yiyu Wang', 'Yaowei Wang', 'Weihua Luo', 'Kaifu Zhang', 'Baotian Hu', 'Min Zhang']"

Traditional approaches, such as CNNs and GANs, offer efficiency but struggle to handle low-quality or complex inputs. Recent advances in text-guided methods leverage large model priors to overcome these limitations, but at the cost of significant computational overhead, both in memory and inference time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for distilling large model priors, eliminating the need for text guidance during inference while dramatically reducing model size. Our framework utilizes a teacher-student architecture, where the teacher network incorporates large model priors and transfers this knowledge to a smaller student network via a tailored distillation process. Additionally, we introduce spatial-channel cross-fusion module to enhance the model's ability to leverage textual priors across both spatial and channel dimensions. Our method achieves a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and fusion quality. The distilled network, requiring only 10\% of the parameters and inference time of the teacher network, retains 90\% of its performance and outperforms existing SOTA methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The implementation will be made publicly available as an open-source resource.","['Ran Zhang', 'Xuanhua He', 'Ke Cao', 'Liu Liu', 'Li Zhang', 'Man Zhou', 'Jie Zhang']"

While state-of-the-art methods rely on tailored and/or high-end equipment for data acquisition, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming, this work introduces a scalable polarization-aided approach that employs cost-effective acquisition tools. By attaching a linear polarizer to readily available RGB cameras, multi-view polarization images can be captured without the need for advance calibration or precise measurements of the polarizer angle, substantially reducing system construction costs. The proposed approach represents polarimetric BRDF, Stokes vectors, and polarization states of object surfaces as neural implicit fields. These fields, combined with the polarizer angle, are retrieved by optimizing the rendering loss of input polarized images. By leveraging fundamental physical principles for the implicit representation of polarization rendering, our method demonstrates superiority over existing techniques through experiments in public datasets and real captured images on both reconstruction and novel view synthesis.","['Bojian Wu', 'Yifan Peng', 'Ruizhen Hu', 'Xiaowei Zhou']"

Current mapping approaches either are limited by the depth range or only map beyond-range entities in constrained settings, where overall they fail to combine within-range and beyond-range observations. Furthermore, these methods make a trade-off between fine-grained semantics and efficiency. We introduce RayFronts, a unified representation that enables both dense and beyond-range efficient semantic mapping. RayFronts encodes task-agnostic open-set semantics to both in-range voxels and beyond-range rays encoded at map boundaries, empowering the robot to reduce search volumes significantly and make informed decisions both within &amp; beyond sensory range, while running at 8.84 Hz on an Orin AGX. Benchmarking the within-range semantics shows that RayFronts's fine-grained image encoding provides 1.34x zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation performance while improving throughput by 16.5x. Traditionally, online mapping performance is entangled with other system components, complicating evaluation. We propose a planner-agnostic evaluation framework that captures the utility for online beyond-range search and exploration, and show RayFronts reduces search volume 2.2x more efficiently than the closest online baselines.","['Omar Alama', 'Avigyan Bhattacharya', 'Haoyang He', 'Seungchan Kim', 'Yuheng Qiu', 'Wenshan Wang', 'Cherie Ho', 'Nikhil Keetha', 'Sebastian Scherer']"

Existing methods aim to generate high-quality 3D digital humans from single or multiple views, but remain primarily constrained by current paradigms and the scarcity of 3D human assets. Specifically, recent approaches fall into several paradigms: optimization-based and feed-forward (both single-view regression and multi-view generation with reconstruction). However, they are limited by slow speed, low quality, cascade reasoning, and ambiguity in mapping low-dimensional planes to high-dimensional space due to occlusion and invisibility, respectively. Furthermore, existing 3D human assets remain small-scale, insufficient for large-scale training. To address these challenges, we propose a latent space generation paradigm for 3D human digitization, which involves compressing multi-view images into Gaussians via a UV-structured VAE, along with DiT-based conditional generation, we transform the ill-posed low-to-high-dimensional mapping problem into a learnable distribution shift, which also supports end-to-end inference. In addition, we employ the multi-view optimization approach combined with synthetic data to construct the HGS-1M dataset, which contains $1$ million 3D Gaussian assets to support the large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that our paradigm, powered by large-scale training, produces high-quality 3D human Gaussians with intricate textures, facial details, and loose clothing deformation.","['Yuhang Yang', 'Fengqi Liu', 'Yixing Lu', 'Qin Zhao', 'Pingyu Wu', 'Wei Zhai', 'Ran Yi', 'Yang Cao', 'Lizhuang Ma', 'Zheng-Jun Zha', 'Junting Dong']"

Solutions based on multi-view RGB images are attractive due to their scalability and affordability, enabling volumetric measurements that 2D approaches cannot directly capture. While advanced methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown promise, their application has been limited to counting or extracting traits from only a few plants or organs. Furthermore, accurately measuring complex structures like individual wheat heads-essential for studying crop yields-remains particularly challenging due to occlusions and the dense arrangement of crop canopies in field conditions. The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising alternative for HTFP due to its high-quality reconstructions and explicit point-based representation. In this paper, we present Wheat3DGS, a novel approach that leverages 3DGS and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise 3D instance segmentation and morphological measurement of hundreds of wheat heads automatically, representing the first application of 3DGS to HTFP. We validate the accuracy of wheat head extraction against high-resolution laser scan data, obtaining per-instance mean absolute percentage errors of 15.1%, 18.3%, and 40.2% for length, width, and volume. We provide additional comparisons to NeRF-based approaches and traditional Muti-View Stereo (MVS), demonstrating superior results.

However, they are sensitive to non-semantic changes in prompt formats, where small changes in the prompt format can lead to significant performance fluctuations. In the literature, this problem is commonly referred to as prompt brittleness. Previous research on prompt engineering has focused mainly on developing techniques for identifying the optimal prompt for specific tasks. Some studies have also explored the issue of prompt brittleness and proposed methods to quantify performance variations; however, no simple solution has been found to address this challenge. We propose Mixture of Formats (MOF), a simple and efficient technique for addressing prompt brittleness in LLMs by diversifying the styles used in the prompt few-shot examples. MOF was inspired by computer vision techniques that utilize diverse style datasets to prevent models from associating specific styles with the target variable. Empirical results show that our proposed technique reduces style-induced prompt brittleness in various LLMs while also enhancing overall performance across prompt variations and different datasets.","['Lilian Ngweta', 'Kiran Kate', 'Jason Tsay', 'Yara Rizk']"

It begins by using a forward distortion model to synthesize barrel-distorted images, reducing pixel redundancy and preventing blur. The network employs a pyramid context encoder with attention mechanisms to generate backward warping flows containing geometric details. Then, a multi-scale decoder is used to restore distorted features and output rectified images. FDBW-Net's performance is validated on diverse datasets: public benchmarks, AirSim-rendered PTZ camera imagery, and real-scene PTZ camera datasets.

While prior work has focused on network architectures and training strategies, the role of dataset curation, especially in balancing and diversifying pre-training datasets, remains underexplored. In EO, this challenge is amplified by the redundancy and heavy-tailed distributions common in satellite imagery, which can lead to biased representations and inefficient training. In this work, we propose a dynamic dataset pruning strategy designed to improve SSL pre-training by maximizing dataset diversity and balance.

The common approach for training a segmentation model relies on a pre-trained feature extractor and a dataset of paired image and mask annotations. These are used to train a lightweight prediction model that translates features into per-pixel classes. The choice of the feature extractor is central to the performance of the final segmentation model, and recent literature has focused on finding tasks to pre-train the feature extractor. In this paper, we propose PathSegDiff, a novel approach for histopathology image segmentation that leverages Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) as pre-trained featured extractors. Our method utilizes a pathology-specific LDM, guided by a self-supervised encoder, to extract rich semantic information from H\&amp;E stained histopathology images. We employ a simple, fully convolutional network to process the features extracted from the LDM and generate segmentation masks. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods on the BCSS and GlaS datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of domain-specific diffusion pre-training in capturing intricate tissue structures and enhancing segmentation accuracy in histopathology images.","['Sachin Kumar Danisetty', 'Alexandros Graikos', 'Srikar Yellapragada', 'Dimitris Samaras']"

Exploring the,"Automatic dietary assessment based on food images remains a challenge, requiring precise food detection, segmentation, and classification. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer new possibilities by integrating visual and textual reasoning. In this study, we evaluate six state-of-the-art VLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Moondream, DeepSeek, and LLaVA), analyzing their capabilities in food recognition at different levels. For the experimental framework, we introduce the FoodNExTDB, a unique food image database that contains 9,263 expert-labeled images across 10 categories (e.g., ""protein source""), 62 subcategories (e.g., ""poultry""), and 9 cooking styles (e.g., ""grilled""). In total, FoodNExTDB includes 50k nutritional labels generated by seven experts who manually annotated all images in the database. Also, we propose a novel evaluation metric, Expert-Weighted Recall (EWR), that accounts for the inter-annotator variability. Results show that closed-source models outperform open-source ones, achieving over 90% EWR in recognizing food products in images containing a single product. Despite their potential, current VLMs face challenges in fine-grained food recognition, particularly in distinguishing subtle differences in cooking styles and visually similar food items, which limits their reliability for automatic dietary assessment.

In this work, we trained two 3D models (nnUNet) with and without anatomical priors to automatically segment lung lesions and quantified total lesion burden for each patient.

In the Earth Observation field, satellite failure or cloud occlusion frequently results in missing time-steps, introducing uncertainties in the predicted output and causing a decline in predictive performance. While many studies address missing time-steps through data augmentation to improve model robustness, the uncertainty arising at the input level is commonly overlooked. To address this gap, we introduce Monte Carlo Temporal Dropout (MC-TD), a method that explicitly accounts for input-level uncertainty by randomly dropping time-steps during inference using a predefined dropout ratio, thereby simulating the effect of missing data. To bypass the need for costly searches for the optimal dropout ratio, we extend this approach with Monte Carlo Concrete Temporal Dropout (MC-ConcTD), a method that learns the optimal dropout distribution directly. Both MC-TD and MC-ConcTD are applied during inference, leveraging Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty quantification. Experiments on three EO time-series datasets demonstrate that MC-ConcTD improves predictive performance and uncertainty calibration compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we highlight the advantages of adaptive dropout tuning over manual selection, making uncertainty quantification more robust and accessible for EO applications.","['Miro Miranda', 'Francisco Mena', 'Andreas Dengel']"

However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of sketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially well-aligned, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit substantial misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training and inference leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in spatial artifacts and significant degradation in overall colorization quality, limiting potential applications of current methods for general purposes. To address this limitation, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the \textbf{carrier}, defined as the latent representation facilitating information transfer from reference to sketch. Based on this analysis, we propose a novel workflow that dynamically adapts the carrier to optimize distinct aspects of colorization. Specifically, for spatially misaligned artifacts, we introduce a split cross-attention mechanism with spatial masks, enabling region-specific reference injection within the diffusion process. To mitigate semantic neglect of sketches, we employ dedicated background and style encoders to transfer detailed reference information in the latent feature space, achieving enhanced spatial control and richer detail synthesis. Furthermore, we propose character-mask merging and background bleaching as preprocessing steps to improve foreground-background integration and background generation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including a user study, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing approaches.

To address these issues, we investigate optimal preprocessing recipes and the impact of background music for AVEL on portrait mode videos. Experiments show that these methods can still benefit from tailored preprocessing and specialized model design, thus achieving improved performance.

While existing methods rely on multi-frame image sequences to identify moving objects, single-image MOS is critical for applications like motion intention prediction and handling camera frame drops. However, segmenting moving objects from a single image remains challenging for existing methods due to the absence of temporal cues. To address this gap, we propose MovSAM, the first framework for single-image moving object segmentation. MovSAM leverages a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enhanced with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to search the moving object and generate text prompts based on deep thinking for segmentation. These prompts are cross-fused with visual features from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and a Vision-Language Model (VLM), enabling logic-driven moving object segmentation.

This innovative approach enables MovSAM to segment moving objects in single images by considering scene understanding. We implement MovSAM in the real world to validate its practical application and effectiveness for autonomous driving scenarios where the multi-frame methods fail.

To tackle this issue, we propose Zeroth-order Intrinsic-dimensional Prompt-tuning (ZIP), a novel approach that enables efficient and robust prompt optimization in a purely black-box setting. The key idea of ZIP is to reduce the problem dimensionality and the variance of zeroth-order gradient estimates, such that the training is done fast with far less queries.

To this end, we propose a new representation-Spatially-varying Gaussian (SVG)-that allows per-Gaussian spatially varying parameters. This enhanced representation is complemented by a SVG splatting scheme akin to vertex/fragment shading in traditional graphics pipelines. Furthermore, we integrate a physically-based indirect lighting model, enabling more realistic relighting. The proposed SVG-IR framework significantly improves rendering quality, outperforming state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods by 2.5 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and surpassing existing Gaussian-based techniques by 3.5 dB in relighting tasks, all while maintaining a real-time rendering speed.","['Hanxiao Sun', 'YuPeng Gao', 'Jin Xie', 'Jian Yang', 'Beibei Wang']"

Automated detection of pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) scans is a challenging task due to variability in nodule size, shape, texture, and location. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown considerable promise in medical image analysis; however, their limited ability to capture fine-grained spatial-spectral variations restricts their performance in complex diagnostic scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that incorporates Chebyshev polynomial expansions into CNN layers to enhance expressive power and improve the representation of underlying anatomical structures. The proposed Chebyshev-CNN leverages the orthogonality and recursive properties of Chebyshev polynomials to extract high-frequency features and approximate complex nonlinear functions with greater fidelity. The model is trained and evaluated on benchmark lung cancer imaging datasets, including LUNA16 and LIDC-IDRI, achieving superior performance in classifying pulmonary nodules as benign or malignant. Quantitative results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to traditional CNN-based approaches. This integration of polynomial-based spectral approximation within deep learning provides a robust framework for enhancing automated medical diagnostics and holds potential for broader applications in clinical decision support systems.","['Abhinav Roy', 'Bhavesh Gyanchandani', 'Aditya Oza']"

Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the \emph{static} inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain \emph{diffusion timesteps} and \emph{spatial regions}. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose \textbf{Dy}namic \textbf{Di}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (DyDiT), an architecture that \emph{dynamically} adjusts its computation along both \emph{timestep} and \emph{spatial} dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a \emph{Timestep-wise Dynamic Width} (TDW) approach that adapts model width conditioned on the generation timesteps. In addition, we design a \emph{Spatial-wise Dynamic Token} (SDT) strategy to avoid redundant computation at unnecessary spatial locations. TDW and SDT can be seamlessly integrated into DiT and significantly accelerates the generation process. Building on these designs, we further enhance DyDiT in three key aspects. First, DyDiT is integrated seamlessly with flow matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT.","['Wangbo Zhao', 'Yizeng Han', 'Jiasheng Tang', 'Kai Wang', 'Hao Luo', 'Yibing Song', 'Gao Huang', 'Fan Wang', 'Yang You']"

While data augmentation certainly helps, it's particularly difficult to generate realistic scene-aware augmented data for outdoor settings. Most current approaches to synthetic data generation focus on realistic object appearance through improved rendering techniques. However, we show that where and how objects are positioned is just as crucial for training effective 3D monocular detectors. The key obstacle lies in automatically determining realistic object placement parameters - including position, dimensions, and directional alignment when introducing synthetic objects into actual scenes. To address this, we introduce MonoPlace3D, a novel system that considers the 3D scene content to create realistic augmentations. Specifically, given a background scene, MonoPlace3D learns a distribution over plausible 3D bounding boxes. Subsequently, we render realistic objects and place them according to the locations sampled from the learned distribution. Our comprehensive evaluation on two standard datasets KITTI and NuScenes, demonstrates that MonoPlace3D significantly improves the accuracy of multiple existing monocular 3D detectors while being highly data efficient.","['Rishubh Parihar', 'Srinjay Sarkar', 'Sarthak Vora', 'Jogendra Kundu', 'R.

To address this, attribution methods have been proposed to assign relevance values to each part of the input. However, different methods often produce entirely different relevance maps, necessitating the development of standardized metrics to evaluate them. Typically, such evaluation is performed through perturbation, wherein high- or low-relevance regions of the input image are manipulated to examine the change in prediction. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, which harnesses image generation models to perform targeted perturbation. Specifically, we focus on inpainting only the high-relevance pixels of an input image to modify the model's predictions while preserving image fidelity. This is in contrast to existing approaches, which often produce out-of-distribution modifications, leading to unreliable results. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating meaningful rankings across a wide range of models and attribution methods. Crucially, we establish that the ranking produced by our metric exhibits significantly higher correlation with human preferences compared to existing approaches, underscoring its potential for enhancing interpretability in DNNs.","['Danielle Cohen', 'Hila Chefer', 'Lior Wolf']"

While conventional manual inspections suffer from subjectivity, existing machine learning-based methods are constrained by their reliance on large and high-quality labeled datasets, which require significant resources and limit adaptability across varied road conditions. The revolutionary advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant potential for overcoming these challenges. In this study, we propose an innovative automated zero-shot learning approach that leverages the image recognition and natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs to assess road conditions effectively. Multiple LLM-based assessment models were developed, employing prompt engineering strategies aligned with the Pavement Surface Condition Index (PSCI) standards. These models' accuracy and reliability were evaluated against official PSCI results, with an optimized model ultimately selected. Extensive tests benchmarked the optimized model against evaluations from various levels experts using Google Street View road images. The results reveal that the LLM-based approach can effectively assess road conditions, with the optimized model -employing comprehensive and structured prompt engineering strategies -outperforming simpler configurations by achieving high accuracy and consistency, even surpassing expert evaluations. Moreover, successfully applying the optimized model to Google Street View images demonstrates its potential for future city-scale deployments.

DI measures the presence of domain-specific information: a lower DI value indicates strong domain dependence, while a higher DI value suggests greater domain independence. This makes it roughly where domain-specific information exists and up to which frequency range it is present. As a result, it becomes possible to effectively suppress only the regions in the image that contain domain-specific information, enabling feature extraction independent of the domain. ADSI uses a Butterworth filter to remove the low-frequency components of images that contain inherent domain-specific information such as sensor characteristics and lighting conditions. However, since low-frequency components also contain important information such as color, we should not remove them completely. Thus, a scalar value (ranging from 0 to 1) is multiplied by the low-frequency components to retain essential information. This helps the model learn more domain-independent features. In experiments, GTA5 (synthetic dataset) was used as training images, and a real-world dataset was used for evaluation, and the proposed method outperformed conventional approaches. Similarly, in experiments that the Cityscapes (real-world dataset) was used for training and various environment datasets such as rain and nighttime were used for evaluation, the proposed method demonstrated its robustness under nighttime conditions.","['Reiji Saito', 'Kazuhiro Hotta']"

A consensus performing CT imaging is to make the radiation dose as low as reasonably achievable, i.e. the ALARA law. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning framework, named End2end-ALARA, that jointly optimizes dose modulation and image reconstruction to meet the goal of ALARA in CT imaging. End2end-ALARA works by building a dose modulation module and an image reconstruction module, connecting these modules with a differentiable simulation function, and optimizing the them with a constrained hinge loss function. The objective is to minimize radiation dose subject to a prescribed image quality (IQ) index. The results show that End2end-ALARA is able to preset personalized dose levels to gain a stable IQ level across patients, which may facilitate image-based diagnosis and downstream model training. Moreover, compared to fixed-dose and conventional dose modulation strategies, End2end-ALARA consumes lower dose to reach the same IQ level.

Existing deep learning approaches for motion artifact correction typically require paired motion-free and motion-affected images for training, which are rarely available in clinical settings. To overcome this requirement, we present DIMA (DIffusing Motion Artifacts), a novel framework that leverages diffusion models to enable unsupervised motion artifact correction in brain MRI. Our two-phase approach first trains a diffusion model on unpaired motion-affected images to learn the distribution of motion artifacts. This model then generates realistic motion artifacts on clean images, creating paired datasets suitable for supervised training of correction networks. Unlike existing methods, DIMA operates without requiring k-space manipulation or detailed knowledge of MRI sequence parameters, making it adaptable across different scanning protocols and hardware. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets and anatomical planes demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised approaches while offering superior generalizability to real clinical data. DIMA represents a significant advancement in making motion artifact correction more accessible for routine clinical use, potentially reducing the need for repeat scans and improving diagnostic accuracy.","['Paolo Angella', 'Luca Balbi', 'Fabrizio Ferrando', 'Paolo Traverso', 'Rosario Varriale', 'Vito Paolo Pastore', 'Matteo Santacesaria']"

In this work, we address the problem of multi-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This enables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation control for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with a set of orientation-aware \textbf{compass} tokens, one for each object, along with text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens taking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of procedurally generated scenes, each containing one or two 3D assets on a plain background. However, direct training this framework results in poor orientation control as well as leads to entanglement among objects. To mitigate this, we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention maps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained model is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not seen during training and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects, indicating strong generalization capabilities. Further, when combined with personalization methods, our method precisely controls the orientation of the new object in diverse contexts. Our method achieves state-of-the-art orientation control and text alignment, quantified with extensive evaluations and a user study.","['Rishbuh Parihar', 'Vaibhav Agrawal', 'Sachidanand VS', 'R.

Their ability to process event-driven inputs, such as data from dynamic vision sensors (DVS), further enhances their applicability to edge computing tasks. However, the resource constraints of edge hardware necessitate techniques like weight quantization, which reduce the memory footprint of SNNs while preserving accuracy. Despite its importance, existing quantization methods typically focus on synaptic weights quantization without taking account of other critical parameters, such as scaling neuron firing thresholds. To address this limitation, we present the first benchmark for the DVS gesture recognition task using SNNs optimized for the many-core neuromorphic chip SpiNNaker2. Our study evaluates two quantization pipelines for fixed-point computations. The first approach employs post training quantization (PTQ) with percentile-based threshold scaling, while the second uses quantization aware training (QAT) with adaptive threshold scaling. Both methods achieve accurate 8-bit on-chip inference, closely approximating 32-bit floating-point performance. Additionally, our baseline SNNs perform competitively against previously reported results without specialized techniques. These models are deployed on SpiNNaker2 using the neuromorphic intermediate representation (NIR). Ultimately, we achieve 94.13% classification accuracy on-chip, demonstrating the SpiNNaker2's potential for efficient, low-energy neuromorphic computing.","['Sirine Arfa', 'Bernhard Vogginger', 'Chen Liu', 'Johannes Partzsch', 'Mark Schone', 'Christian Mayr']"

This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing a robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to assess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our protocol uses multi-resolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to create rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities of the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and nearest-neighbor methods.

Specifically, we advocate for the incorporation of a retrieval mechanism during the generation phase. The retrieved videos act as grounding signals, providing the model with demonstrations of how the objects move. Our pipeline is designed to apply to any text-to-video diffusion model, conditioning a pretrained model on the retrieved samples with minimal fine-tuning. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through established metrics, recently proposed benchmarks, and qualitative results, and we highlight additional applications of the framework.","['Elia Peruzzo', 'Dejia Xu', 'Xingqian Xu', 'Humphrey Shi', 'Nicu Sebe']"

To generate long-form, high-quality captions, many recent studies have employed multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, current MLLMs often produce captions that lack fine-grained details or suffer from hallucinations, a challenge that persists in both open-source and closed-source models. Inspired by Feature-Integration theory, which suggests that attention must focus on specific regions to integrate visual information effectively, we propose a \textbf{divide-then-aggregate} strategy. Our method first divides the image into semantic and spatial patches to extract fine-grained details, enhancing the model's local perception of the image. These local details are then hierarchically aggregated to generate a comprehensive global description. To address hallucinations and inconsistencies in the generated captions, we apply a semantic-level filtering process during hierarchical aggregation. This training-free pipeline can be applied to both open-source models (LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-1.6, Mini-Gemini) and closed-source models (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, GLM-4V-Plus). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates more detailed, reliable captions, advancing multimodal description generation without requiring model retraining.

While existing approaches primarily aim to enhance the performance of estimated 2D poses, they often struggle when applied to ground-truth 2D pose data. We observe that achieving accurate 3D pose reconstruction from ground-truth 2D poses requires precise modeling of local pose structures, alongside the ability to extract robust global spatio-temporal features. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Hyper-GCN and Shuffle Mamba (HGMamba) block, which processes input data through two parallel streams: Hyper-GCN and Shuffle-Mamba. The Hyper-GCN stream models the human body structure as hypergraphs with varying levels of granularity to effectively capture local joint dependencies. Meanwhile, the Shuffle Mamba stream leverages a state space model to perform spatio-temporal scanning across all joints, enabling the establishment of global dependencies. By adaptively fusing these two representations, HGMamba achieves strong global feature modeling while excelling at local structure modeling. We stack multiple HGMamba blocks to create three variants of our model, allowing users to select the most suitable configuration based on the desired speed-accuracy trade-off. Extensive evaluations on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. HGMamba-B achieves state-of-the-art results, with P1 errors of 38.65 mm and 14.33 mm on the respective datasets.

While Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models improve SISR by capturing long-range dependencies, they suffer from quadratic computational costs or employ selective attention mechanisms that do not explicitly focus on query-relevant regions. Despite these advancements, prior work has overlooked how selective attention mechanisms should be effectively designed for SISR. We propose SSCAN, which dynamically selects the most relevant key-value windows based on query similarity, ensuring focused feature extraction while maintaining efficiency. In contrast to prior approaches that apply attention globally or heuristically, our method introduces a query-aware window selection strategy that better aligns attention computation with important image regions. By incorporating fixed-sized windows, SSCAN reduces memory usage and enforces linear token-to-token complexity, making it scalable for large images. Our experiments demonstrate that SSCAN outperforms existing attention-based SISR methods, achieving up to 0.14 dB PSNR improvement on urban datasets, guaranteeing both computational efficiency and reconstruction quality in SISR.","['Junyoung Kim', 'Youngrok Kim', 'Siyeol Jung', 'Donghyun Min']"

Creating such posters using modern image generation methods is valuable, while the main challenge lies in accurately rendering text, especially for complex writing systems like Chinese, which contains over 10,000 individual characters. In this work, we identify the key to precise text rendering as constructing a character-discriminative visual feature as a control signal. Based on this insight, we propose a robust character-wise representation as control and we develop TextRenderNet, which achieves a high text rendering accuracy of over 90%. Another challenge in poster generation is maintaining the fidelity of user-specific products. We address this by introducing SceneGenNet, an inpainting-based model, and propose subject fidelity feedback learning to further enhance fidelity.

To address this, we propose a simple normalization strategy tailored for IR Transformers. Our approach applies normalization across the entire spatio-channel dimension, effectively preserving spatial correlations. Additionally, we introduce an input-adaptive rescaling method that aligns feature statistics to the unique statistical requirements of each input.

We generalize prior work that study binary alignment classification of registration errors, by recasting it as multinomial misalignment classification. To achieve this, we introduce a custom regression-by-classification loss function that combines the cross-entropy and Wasserstein losses, and demonstrate that it outperforms both direct regression and prior binary classification. FACT successfully classifies point-cloud pairs registered with both the classical ICP and GeoTransformer, while other choices, such as standard point-cloud-quality metrics and registration residuals are shown to be poor choices for predicting misalignment.

To achieve stereoscopic impression of the decal, we introduce shadow factor into IBL, which can be adaptively optimized during training. This allows the shadow brightness of surfaces to be accurately decomposed rather than baked into the diffuse color, ensuring that the edited texture exhibits authentic shading. To address the issues of warping and blurriness in previous methods, we apply As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) parameterization to pre-unfold a specified area of the mesh and use the local UV mapping combined with a neural texture map to enhance the ability to express high-frequency details in that area. For instant editing, we utilize the Disney BRDF model, explicitly defining material colors with 3-channel diffuse albedo. This enables instant replacement of albedo RGB values during the editing process, avoiding the prolonged optimization required in previous approaches. In our experiment, we introduce the Ratio Variance Warping (RVW) metric to evaluate the local geometric warping of the decal area.

While several algorithms exhibit compositionality, they fail to elucidate how humans learn to compose concept classes and ground visual cues through trial and error. To investigate this multi-modal learning challenge, we designed a 3D synthetic environment in which an agent learns, via reinforcement, to navigate to a target specified by a natural language instruction. These instructions comprise nouns, attributes, and critically, determiners, prepositions, or both. The vast array of word combinations heightens the compositional complexity of the visual grounding task, as navigating to a blue cube above red spheres is not rewarded when the instruction specifies navigating to ""some blue cubes below the red sphere"". We first demonstrate that reinforcement learning agents can ground determiner concepts to visual targets but struggle with more complex prepositional concepts. Second, we show that curriculum learning, a strategy humans employ, enhances concept learning efficiency, reducing the required training episodes by 15% in determiner environments and enabling agents to easily learn prepositional concepts. Finally, we establish that agents trained on determiner or prepositional concepts can decompose held-out test instructions and rapidly adapt their navigation policies to unseen visual object combinations.

Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from sentence-level text embeddings. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL-divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training.

Thus, how to effectively leverage existing data knowledge to enable models to quickly adapt to class variations under non-i.i.d. assumptions has emerged as a key research challenge. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new cross-domain few-shot learning approach based on domain knowledge mapping, applied consistently throughout the pre-training, training, and testing phases. In the pre-training phase, our method integrates self-supervised and supervised losses by maximizing mutual information, thereby mitigating mode collapse. During the training phase, the domain knowledge mapping layer collaborates with a domain classifier to learn both domain mapping capabilities and the ability to assess domain adaptation difficulty. Finally, this approach is applied during the testing phase, rapidly adapting to domain variations through meta-training tasks on support sets, consequently enhancing the model's capability to transfer domain knowledge effectively.

Most existing methods aim to bridge this gap by aligning features across source and target domains but often fail to account for visual differences, such as color or orientation, in alignment pairs. This limitation leads to less effective domain adaptation, as the model struggles to manage both domain-specific shifts (e.g., fog) and visual variations simultaneously. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time, using a custom-built dataset, that aligning visually similar pairs significantly improves domain adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose a novel memory-based system to enhance domain alignment. This system stores precomputed features of foreground objects and background areas from the source domain, which are periodically updated during training. By retrieving visually similar source features for alignment with target foreground and background features, the model effectively addresses domain-specific differences while reducing the impact of visual variations.

MLLMs exhibit early performance plateaus, while vision-only methods improve throughout the small-data regime, with performance gaps widening beyond 10 training examples. We provide the first comprehensive comparison between these approaches in small-data contexts and advocate for explicit small-data evaluations in AI research to better bridge theoretical advances with practical deployments.","['Samuel Stevens', 'S M Rayeed', 'Jenna Kline']"

While most existing sensor-fusion approaches are designed for specific scenarios, this work introduces a flexible open-source solution for task- and setup-agnostic multimodal sensor fusion that is distinguished by its generality and usability. Holistic Fusion formulates sensor fusion as a combined estimation problem of i) the local and global robot state and ii) a (theoretically unlimited) number of dynamic context variables, including automatic alignment of reference frames; this formulation fits countless real-world applications without any conceptual modifications. The proposed factor-graph solution enables the direct fusion of an arbitrary number of absolute, local, and landmark measurements expressed with respect to different reference frames by explicitly including them as states in the optimization and modeling their evolution as random walks. Moreover, local smoothness and consistency receive particular attention to prevent jumps in the robot state belief. HF enables low-latency and smooth online state estimation on typical robot hardware while simultaneously providing low-drift global localization at the IMU measurement rate. The efficacy of this released framework is demonstrated in five real-world scenarios on three robotic platforms, each with distinct task requirements.","['Julian Nubert', 'Turcan Tuna', 'Jonas Frey', 'Cesar Cadena', 'Katherine J.

Though several resources exist to obtain this information, they often lack the required temporal resolution for short-term monitoring (e.g., every hour). To address this issue, this study implements a low-cost ZED 2i stereo camera system and close-range photogrammetry to collect images for generating 3D point clouds, digital surface models (DSMs) of beach elevation, and georectified imagery at a localized scale and high temporal resolution. The main contributions of this study are (i) intrinsic camera calibration, (ii) georectification and registration of acquired imagery and point cloud, (iii) generation of the DSM of the beach elevation, and (iv) a comparison of derived products against those from uncrewed aircraft system structure-from-motion photogrammetry. Preliminary results show that despite its limitations, the ZED 2i can provide the desired mapping products at localized and high temporal scales. The system achieved a mean reprojection error of 0.20 px, a point cloud registration of 27 cm, a vertical error of 37.56 cm relative to ground truth, and georectification root mean square errors of 2.67 cm and 2.81 cm for x and y.","['José A.

In ground-based astronomy, combining multiple exposures to enhance signal-to-noise ratios is further complicated by variations in the point-spread function caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we present a self-supervised multi-frame method, based on deep image priors, for denoising, deblurring, and coadding ground-based exposures. Central to our approach is a carefully designed convolutional neural network that integrates information across multiple observations and enforces physically motivated constraints. We demonstrate the method's potential by processing Hyper Suprime-Cam exposures, yielding promising preliminary results with sharper restored images.","['Yashil Sukurdeep', 'Fausto Navarro', 'Tamás Budavári']"

This paper targets making classification models more robust to occlusions for the task of object recognition by proposing a pipeline that utilizes a frozen diffusion model. Diffusion features have demonstrated success in image generation and image completion while understanding image context. Occlusion can be posed as an image completion problem by deeming the pixels of the occluder to be `missing.' We hypothesize that such features can help hallucinate object visual features behind occluding objects, and hence we propose using them to enable models to become more occlusion robust. We design experiments to include input-based augmentations as well as feature-based augmentations. Input-based augmentations involve finetuning on images where the occluder pixels are inpainted, and feature-based augmentations involve augmenting classification features with intermediate diffusion features. We demonstrate that our proposed use of diffusion-based features results in models that are more robust to partial object occlusions for both Transformers and ConvNets on ImageNet with simulated occlusions. We also propose a dataset that encompasses real-world occlusions and demonstrate that our method is more robust to partial object occlusions.","['Rupayan Mallick', 'Sibo Dong', 'Nataniel Ruiz', 'Sarah Adel Bargal']"

Current screening methodologies lack standardization, and AI-driven studies suffer from reproducibility issues due to limited data and code availability. To address these limitations, we introduce Retuve, an open-source framework for multi-modality DDH analysis, encompassing both ultrasound (US) and X-ray imaging. Retuve provides a complete and reproducible workflow, offering open datasets comprising expert-annotated US and X-ray images, pre-trained models with training code and weights, and a user-friendly Python Application Programming Interface (API). The framework integrates segmentation and landmark detection models, enabling automated measurement of key diagnostic parameters such as the alpha angle and acetabular index. By adhering to open-source principles, Retuve promotes transparency, collaboration, and accessibility in DDH research. This initiative has the potential to democratize DDH screening, facilitate early diagnosis, and ultimately improve patient outcomes by enabling widespread screening and early intervention.

Particularly, we revisit residual NNs due to their popularity in computer vision and our hypothesis that residual blocks are a primary cause of data leakage owing to the use of skip connections. By formulating inference-time data leakage as a constrained optimization problem, we propose a novel backward feature inversion method, \textbf{PEEL}, which can effectively recover block-wise input features from the intermediate output of residual NNs. The surprising results in high-quality input data recovery can be explained by the intuition that the output from these residual blocks can be considered as a noisy version of the input and thus the output retains sufficient information for input recovery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our layer-by-layer feature inversion method on facial image datasets and pre-trained classifiers. Our results show that PEEL outperforms the state-of-the-art recovery methods by an order of magnitude when evaluated by mean squared error (MSE).

Despite recent advancements, their underlying loss landscapes and optimization dynamics received less attention. In this paper, we investigate and analyze machine unlearning through the lens of mode connectivity - the phenomenon where independently trained models can be connected by smooth low-loss paths in the parameter space. We define and study mode connectivity in unlearning across a range of overlooked conditions, including connections between different unlearning methods, models trained with and without curriculum learning, and models optimized with first-order and secondorder techniques. Our findings show distinct patterns of fluctuation of different evaluation metrics along the curve, as well as the mechanistic (dis)similarity between unlearning methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on mode connectivity in the context of machine unlearning.","['Jiali Cheng', 'Hadi Amiri']"

Existing approaches lack mechanisms to incorporate auxiliary ""side information"" that could enhance reconstruction accuracy in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, the most accurate methods rely on cropped person detections and cannot exploit scene context while methods that process the whole image often fail to detect people and are less accurate than methods that use crops. While recent language-based methods explore HPS reasoning through large language or vision-language models, their metric accuracy is well below the state of the art. In contrast, we present PromptHMR, a transformer-based promptable method that reformulates HPS estimation through spatial and semantic prompts. Our method processes full images to maintain scene context and accepts multiple input modalities: spatial prompts like bounding boxes and masks, and semantic prompts like language descriptions or interaction labels. PromptHMR demonstrates robust performance across challenging scenarios: estimating people from bounding boxes as small as faces in crowded scenes, improving body shape estimation through language descriptions, modeling person-person interactions, and producing temporally coherent motions in videos. Experiments on benchmarks show that PromptHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering flexible prompt-based control over the HPS estimation process.","['Yufu Wang', 'Yu Sun', 'Priyanka Patel', 'Kostas Daniilidis', 'Michael J.
